Centrifugo v5 is fully compatible with Centrifugo v4. The only difference is client SDK behaviour regarding token management - see in [our release post](https://centrifugal.dev/blog/2023/06/29/centrifugo-v5-released#token-behaviour-adjustments-in-sdks).

So examples from [v4](https://github.com/centrifugal/examples/tree/master/v4) should perfectly fit educational purposes.
